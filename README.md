# Aquarium

This project uses React.js and Three.js to make some lovely low poly fish swim around!
I made this as I was feeling a bit down and these fishes are making me happy again! (I need to fix the scaling, movements and some other stuff...)

Atleast I got to learn Three.js for this project!

## Low Poly Fishes
